## Tuberculosis Patterns in Comparison to Income, Weather, Demographics, Location

### Introduction

#### What is tuberculosis?
An infectious disease caused by bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
a small, aerobic, nonmotile bacillus.  most common in lungs
High lipid content. 
Slow division - divides each 16-20 hours
Have an outer membrane lipid bilayer
Can sithstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state. 

Sometimes infection spreads outside lungs (15-20%) - causing other kinds of TB
Spread to lymph nodes common - may cause ulcers. 

Affects the lungs, but can affect the lungs but also other parts of the body.

Often no symptoms - latent tuberculosis -> progress to active disease which if untreated kills half
of those infected

Symptoms
Symptoms are active TV are chronic cough with 
clood, fever, night sweats and weight loss. 
fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue. 
Chest pain
Rare case - erosion of a pulmonary artery or a Rasmussen's aneurysm resulting in massive cleeding. 


Causes, Risks and Spread
Spread through the air (cough, spit, speak, sneeze), unless latent
More often for people with HIV/AIDS (13% of all people with TB are infected by virus) and those that smoke
 Overcrowding and malnutrition
 people who inject drugs, inhabitants and employees of vulnerable people, medically underprivileged and resource-poor communities, 
 high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health care providers
 Chronic long disease
 Alcoholism, diabetes
 

 
Diagnosis
Chest X-rays, microscopic examination of body fluids
Tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests
Histological stains from phlegm - can identify MTB (ziehl neelsen stain and kinyoun stain are the most common)


Stats
In 2014, 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted 1.5 million deaths. 
Common in developing countries
Decreases steadily year by year
80% of asian and african countries test positive for TB, 5-10% in US.
